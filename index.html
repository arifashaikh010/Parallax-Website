                The dream of flying in the sky just like a bird is as old as human kind. You can make your dream come true with paragliding. This sport is considered to be risky, but the reality is that the safety of practitioners is quite high, especially compared to other adventure disciplines. Of course, you cannot paraglide unless you have undergone extensive training. There are numerous paragliding schools that you can select from. It is only natural for you to look for courses in your local area, but there are a number of other essential factors that you have to consider carefully as well.

                Paragliding is a type of extreme sport found by people interested in aerial sports, and it allows one to run off the slopes with free parachutes. Paragliding is generally more accessible than other extreme sports since it does not require a special take off or a landing track. Paragliding is also the fastest developed air sport in the world.

                Surfing, sport of riding breaking waves towards the shore, particularly by means of a board. Surfing’s roots dwell pre-modern Hawaii and Polynesia, where the game was practiced by both men and women from all social strata from royalty to commoners. India’s 7500 kilometre coastline provides several spots for surfboarding. The largest waves are typically seen between May and September, the pre-monsoon and monsoon season
                <br> <br>
                Surfing in India is growing in quality, and there are some great spots along the country’s vast coastline where you can catch a wave and also learn to surf. The only issue is that the waves are not consistent and also the surf will flop sometimes. You just need to be at the correct place at the correct time!
